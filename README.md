# Game Design Document: "Who's the Best CDO?"

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a gamified web application that simulates the role of a Chief Data Officer (CDO). Users will make strategic decisions based on email scenarios that affect budget, data quality, company profit, and reputation.

## 📆 Game Overview

### Title: Who's the Best CDO?

### Genre: Role-Based Decision Simulation

### Mode: Single Player

### Target Audience: Data professionals, aspiring data leaders, and corporate learners

---

## 🚀 Gameplay Flow

1. **User Onboarding**

   - User selects a difficulty level (Easy / Hard).
   - User is briefed on their role and key metrics to track.

2. **Inbox System**

   - User receives up to 7 emails at a time (Inbox 0/7).
   - Each email is a scenario-based decision from different departments.
   - Emails are categorized (e.g., STRATEGY, DATAQUALITY, MISC).

3. **Decision Making**

   - User reads an email and selects one response from multiple options.
   - Each choice impacts one or more of the following metrics:
     - 💰 Budget
     - 📊 Company Profit
     - 📈 Data Quality
     - ⭐ Reputation

4. **Game End**

   - When all scenarios are completed or time runs out, a summary screen is shown.
   - Feedback is provided based on the user's performance across all metrics.

## 🎯 Metrics & Logic

### Player State Object

```json
{
  "budget": 1000000,
  "profit": 0,
  "dataQuality": 0,
  "reputation": 0,
  "inbox": []
}
```

### Scenario JSON Structure

```json
{
  "from": "Marketing Director",
  "subject": "Consent Management for Marketing Campaigns",
  "content": "The conservative approach...",
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "Launch enrichment project",
      "budget": -10000,
      "profit": 100000,
      "dataQuality": 10,
      "reputation": 5,
      "conditions": { "minReputation": 10 }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Game Rules

- **Max Inbox**: 7 emails max before burnout.
- **Reputation Gating**: Certain actions are locked unless the user has enough reputation.
- **Metric Updates**: Each action updates metrics instantly and visually.
- **Timer**: Limits session duration (optional).
